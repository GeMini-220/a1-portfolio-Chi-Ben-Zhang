--Readme document for Ben Zhang, *zhangc41@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- */1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */1 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
- Appropriate headings and paragraph text
- Links to external page(s)
- Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer (nav, sections)

(b) CSS features
- Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
- Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing
- Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality, including appropriate fallbacks

(c) Advanced features
- Creating a more complex page layout (collapsable navigation bar)
- Leveraging nested selectors to specify format



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
There were none ignored.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
about 5 hrs (most were spent on the nav bar frankly)


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
For design, I consulted the previous examples provided on https://inf133-wi26.depstein.net/assignments/a1
For basic html syntax, I was searching on w3school
For bootstrap classes and syntax, I was consulting AI agents. I would first ask a general question, such as "I want to make a navigation bar with bootstrap, what should I do?", then ask them to explain all the related classes, in order to get a general grasp of the syntax and knowledge structure. I would then start the implementation and come back to ask more specific questions when I ran into unkown issues. For example, like "I want to make my navigation buttons align to the right, what should I do?" or "How to make my nav bar collapse on md or lower screens?" 


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
There were none.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
None.
